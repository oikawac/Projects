Gravity Simulator is a program that will simulate the movement of masses under newtonian gravity

where F = (Gm1m2)/r^2 and G is taken to be 1

Gravity Simulator will compile on the McGill Computer Science Mimi server as well as mac and most linux distributions

To run Gravity Simulator make sure to execute the compileall.sh script at least once and then execute launch.sh to run the program

below is a screenshot of the program running
