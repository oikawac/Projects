C273 Assemnbly Matrix Multiplier
  This is a program written in MIPS assembly to multiply two square matrices for the COMP 273 class. This program
  placed 2nd in a class of over 250 students when ranked against other student submissions in terms of runtime.
  
  In order to run this code a MIPS emulator must be used MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is recommended.
  
C424 AI Pentago Twist Agent
  This is an AI agent that was created for COMP 424 to compete against other student submissions, this program placed
  2nd in a class of 400 students. The program is written in JAVA, it utilizes a Monte-Carlo search tree with an upper 
  confidence heuristic strategy. Computation is greatly accelerated by the liberal use of bitboard data representation.
  This technique is popular in chess-programming competitions.
  
  In order to run this code the file COMP_424__code_description.pdf should be consulted.
  
E301 Dynamic Hadley Cell Climate Model
  This is a matlab 4-box climate model of the hadley circulation which can simulate the potential affects of CO2 forcing
  on the strength of the circulation. This was coded for the ESYS 301 class with a scientific report to accompany the 
  model.
  
Terminal Physics Engine
  This is a simulation of newtonian physics on point masses in a frictionless 2D universe completely displayed to the 
  terminal without any additional libraries for managing the TUI. The code is written in C and compiles on macos and linux. 
  This project was done for a seminar taught by Martin Robillard of McGill University and was awarded 3rd place among 
  final projects submitted.
  
Rotor
  This is an App developed for iPhone written in Swift targeting iOS 11.0. This code is very old and does not run on modern
  phones but can be launched in an XCode simulator of an iPhone 6 or higher running iOS 11.0.
  
  This was an early project the code is bad.
